      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
	This document addresses concerns related to the text-to-speech
	functionality in HTML documents and EPUB publications that
	contain ruby annotations. While typographical aspects of ruby
	are covered by [[?JLREQ]], text-to-speech
	issues in this context have not received widespread
	recognition. The primary focus of this document is to outline
	user requirements.</p>
      <p>
	In Section 2, we enumerate the various roles of ruby
	annotations in relation to their associated ruby
	bases. Section 3 provides an overview of potential options for
	using ruby bases and/or ruby annotations in text-to-speech,
	along with a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of
	each option. Section 4 addresses markup issues related to the
	text-to-speech of ruby annotations. Section 5 introduces
	alternative mechanisms, such as SSML and PLS. Section 6 delves
	into the use of ruby annotations in translating HTML or EPUB
	content to braille.</p>

      <h2>Roles of ruby annotations</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>Furigana, background</h3>
        <p>
	  The primary purpose of ruby annotations is to indicate how
	  to pronounce CJK ideographic characters, a practice known
	  as <dfn>Furigana</dfn> (see also <a data-cite="JLREQ#term.furigana">JLReq terminology</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
	  In contemporary usage, it is uncommon to attach ruby
	  annotations to all CJK ideographic characters
	  (<dfn>fully-annotated ruby</dfn>). Instead, it is common to
	  attach ruby annotations to some CJK ideographic characters
	  (<dfn>partially-annotated ruby</dfn>).
        </p>
        <p>Ruby annotations find their application in various
        contexts, including trade books, newspapers, textbooks,
        teaching materials, and more, but are rarely utilized in
        business documents.</p>
        <p>
          Even for simple CJK ideographic characters, ruby annotations may be added for some users who have particular 
          difficulties with CJK ideographic characters 
          (in electronic documents, it is easy to make ruby annotations visible or invisible based on user preferences). 
          Such ruby annotations are called as furigana-added-for-enhanced-accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some simple CJK ideographic characters have more than one possible reading and thus require ruby annotations for disambiguation.  
          This is common for names of people and places. For example, "<span lang="ja">山崎</span>" (a person's name) may be read as 
          "Yamazaki" or "Yamasaki". 
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case of partially-annotated ruby, ruby annotations are often attached to the first occurrence of each CJK ideographic character, 
          and not attached to the second and subsequent occurrences of the same character, 
          probably because users should learn from the first occurrence.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Gikun, background</h3>
        <p>
          Especially in Japan, ruby annotations are
	  also used to indicate something different from the reading of a CJK ideographic character.
          Such ruby is referred to as <dfn>Gikun</dfn>.  Gikun is commonly employed in light novels and comics. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are some examples of Gikun:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span lang="ja"><ruby><rb>敵</rb><rt>とも</rt></ruby></span> 
            (where <span lang="ja">敵</span> means "enemy" and <span lang="ja">とも</span> means "friend").  The combination means "frenemy".
          </li>
            <span lang="ja"><ruby><rb>生命</rb><rt>いのち</rt></ruby></span> 
            (where the typical reading of <span lang="ja">生命</span> is SEIMEI rather than <span lang="ja">いのち</span> (INOCHI), 
            both of which mean "Life")
          </li>
          <li>
            <span lang="ja"><ruby><rb>背景</rb><rt>バック</rt></ruby></span> 
            (where the typical reading of <span lang="ja">背景</span> is HAIKEI rather than <span lang="ja">バック</span> ("back"), 
            an English translation)
          </li>
          <li>
            <span lang="ja"><ruby><rb>牛乳</rb><rt>ミルク</rt></ruby></span> 
            (where the typical reading of <span lang="ja">牛乳</span> is GYUUNYUU rather than <span lang="ja">ミルク</span> ("milk"), 
            an English translation)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Even when Gikun is used for a compound word, it is unlikely to be repeated for later occurrences of the same word. 
          Moreover, different [=GIKUN=] may be added for subsequent occurrences of the same word. 
          For example, the next occurrence of <span lang="ja">生命</span> may well be 
          <span lang="ja"><ruby><rb>生命</rb><rt>ライフ</rt></ruby></span>
          where <span lang="ja">ライフ</span> ("life") is an English translation.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Unusual names of people and places, background</h3>
	<p>
	  Unusual names of people in Japan are typically written
	  using CJK ideographic characters but are pronounced quite
	  differently from the standard reading of these
	  characters. For instance, <span lang="ja"><ruby>
	      <rb>男</rb><rt>あだむ</rt></ruby></span> is an unusual name,
	  where <span lang="ja">男</span> (usually read as 'OTOKO')
	  means 'man', and <span lang="ja">あだむ</span> represents
	  'Adam' in Kana.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Character names in comics, animations, and light novels can
	  sometimes be extremely challenging to pronounce. Many of the
	  character names
	  in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_Slayer:_Kimetsu_no_Yaiba">Demon
	  Slayer (Kimetsu no Yaiba)</a> fall into this category. For
	  example, almost no one can read
	  <span lang="ja">不死川 玄弥</span> as 'Shinazugawa Gennya' without assistance.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Names of places can also be difficult to read due to
	  historical reasons. For instance, <span lang="ja"><ruby>
	      <rb>神居古潭</rb><rt>かむいこたん</rt></ruby></span>,
          <span lang="ja"><ruby><rb>温根沼</rb><rt>おんねとう</rt></ruby></span>, 
          <span lang="ja"><ruby><rb>音威子府</rb><rt>おといねっぷ</rt></ruby></span>
	  are names of places in Hokkaido (the northern
	  island of Japan). These names are challenging to pronounce
	  because they originated from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ainu_people#Language">the Ainu language</a>,
	  which is
	  entirely different from the Japanese language.
	</p>
	<p>	  
	In many instances, the first occurrence of an unusual name is accompanied by a ruby annotation, but subsequent occurrences are not.
	</p>

        <h3>Interlinear notes, background</h3>
        <p>
          <dfn>Interlinear notes</dfn> resemble ruby annotations in appearance.  
          A <a data-cite="JLREQ#n224">note in JLreq</a> introduces interlinear notes as follows:
        </p>
        <aside class="note" title="Quoted note from JLReq" id="n20211101001">
          Other than these styles of note, explanations of facts and persons in study aid books and history texts, 
          and modern translations of Japanese classic texts are sometimes set between lines. 
          These notes are called interlinear notes (see <a data-cite="JLREQ#fig3_2_8">Figure 241</a>).
        </aside>
        <p>
          In the example shown in 
          <a data-cite="JLREQ#fig3_2_8">a figure referenced in the quoted note ("An example of a note in inter lines")</a>, 
          <span lang="ja">徳川慶喜</span> (Tokugawa Yoshinobu) is accompanied by an interlinear note 
          "1837-1913 <span lang="ja">江戸幕府最後の将軍</span>" (1837-1913 the last shogun of the Edo shogunate). 
          Other examples are: a modern kana phrase as an interlinear note for a historical kana phrase, 
          a standard Japanese expression as an interlinear note for an expression in a dialect, 
          a modern CJK ideographic character as an interlinear note for a traditional CJK ideographic character, 
          an English text chunk as an interlinear note for a Japanese text chunk, 
          and an official name as an interlinear note for an abbreviated name.
        </p>
        <p>
          One could argue that HTML ruby elements should not be used for representing interlinear notes 
          (see <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-japanese/2021AprJun/0051.html">Kobayashi Sensei's mail in Japanese</a>). 
          However, it is not difficult to imagine that ruby elements are actually used for representing interlinear notes.
        </p>

        <h3>Ruby annotations for indicating the pronunciation of foreign phrases in language textbooks, background</h3>
        <p>
	  In language textbooks, ruby annotations are at times
	  employed to indicate the pronunciation of foreign phrases
	  written in hiragana or katakana. For example, a Chinese
	  phrase <span lang="zh-hans">我去学校</span> may include
	  <span lang="ja">ウオ チュー シュエシャオ</span> as a ruby annotation.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Double-sided Ruby, background</h3>
        <p>
          A sequence of characters can be accompanied by two ruby annotations,
	  typically consisting of [=Furigana=] and either [=GIKUN=] or an [=interlinear note=].  
          In <a data-cite="JLREQ#fig2_3_12">an example provided in JLreq</a> 
          ("An example of ruby attached to both sides of the base characters"), 
          <span lang="ja">東南</span> is accompanied by <span lang="ja">たつみ</span> and <span lang="ja">とうなん</span>. 
          Here <span lang="ja">東南</span> means "southeast", with <span lang="ja">とうなん</span> (TOUNAN) serving as [=Furigana=], 
          and <span lang="ja">たつみ</span> (Tatsumi) as [=GIKUN=], 
          as <span lang="ja">辰巳</span> (read as <span lang="ja">たつみ</span>) indicates the same direction as <span lang="ja">東南</span>.
        </p>

	<p>We offer two additional illustrative examples.</p>

        <figure id="f20211101001">
          <img src="./img/rdr001.svg" alt="Double-sided ruby example 1" width="65" height="54" />
          <figcaption><span lang="ja">東洋</span> features an upper-side ruby annotation <span lang="ja">オリエント</span> and a lower-side ruby annotation <span lang="ja">とうよう</span></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
	  In this example, <span lang="ja">とうよう</span> serves as [=Furigana=], while <span lang="ja">オリエント</span> is used as [=Gikun=]
        </p>
        <figure id="f20211101002">
          <img src="./img/rdr002.svg" alt="Double-sided ruby example 2" width="110" height="53" />
          <figcaption><span lang="ja">織田信長</span> features an upper-side ruby annotation <span lang="ja">"1534〜82"</span> and a lower-side ruby annotation <span lang="ja">おだのぶなが</span></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          In this example, <span lang="ja">おだのぶなが</span> serves as [=Furigana=], while <span lang="ja">"1534〜82"</span> is presented as an [=interlinear note=].
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
	<h3>Zaima, background</h3>
	<p>The primary purpose of zaima annotation is to indicate
	vocal inflection and intonation of the base text to produce a
	melody when a complete passage is vocalized. Zaima is the
	annotation practice of the Ge'ez language hymnal tradition
	which in layout is visually identical to Furigana annotation
	and shares formatting requirements.</p>

	<p>The zaima annotation elements may be one of 8 basic shape
	notes, or will be a one or two letter abbreviation of a word
	from a large vocabulary. These elements cue the reader for how
	to inflect their voice when reading the base text aloud. A
	hymn may be recited under different melodies depending on the
	occasion. These alternative vocalizations will draw from
	separate vocabulary collections and in writing will be laid
	out above the base text on higher level rows.</p>

	<p>Multiple rows of annotation are common in the written zaima
	hymnal practice. It is crucial for the reader to be aware of
	the row context to then be able to decode the abbreviations
	under the proper vocabulary set. Identical abbreviations can
	be found across vocabularies, but referencing entirely
	different words with different inflection patterns. For the
	execution of this decoding, awareness of the annotation row
	context is just as crucial when only a single row is
	present.</p>

	<p>Here are some examples of zaima that highlight the
	importance of identifying the context of the annotation
	row:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>በከ<ruby><rb>መ</rb><rt>᎑</rt></ruby>፡አር<ruby ><rb>ኃ</rb><rt>ቁ</rt></ruby><ruby><rb>ወ</rb><rt align="right">ር</rt></ruby>፡ዳ<ruby ><rb>ን</rb><rt>ዮ</rt></ruby>ኤ<ruby><rb>ል</rb><rt>ዑ</rt></ruby>፡<ruby><rb>ነ</rb><rt>᎐</rt></ruby>ቢ<ruby><rb>ይ</rb><rt>ርስ</rt></ruby>፡መ<ruby><rb>ሣክ</rb><rt>አክ</rt></ruby><ruby><rb>ወ</rb><rt>᎑</rt></ruby>፡ቤ<ruby><rb>ቱ</rb><rt>ዕት</rt></ruby>፡ <br>Here

      <h2>Which should be read aloud, ruby bases or ruby annotations, or both?</h2>
      <p>
        There are three possible options: (1) both ruby bases and ruby annotations, (2) ruby annotations only, and (3) ruby bases only.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Reading aloud both ruby bases and ruby annoations</h3>
        <p>
          In this option, ruby bases are read aloud first and ruby annotations are then read aloud. 
          Many implementations (screen readers, in particular) support this option only. 
          For example, <ruby><rb>foo</rb><rt>bar</rt></ruby> is read aloud as "foo bar".
        </p>

        <section>
          <h4>Furigana, when both read aloud</h4>
          <p>
            The option of reading aloud both interferes with readers' understanding significantly. 
            This is true for both group ruby (see also <a data-cite="JLREQ#term.group-ruby">JLReq terminology</a>) 
            and mono ruby (see also <a data-cite="JLREQ#term.mono-ruby">JLReq terminology</a>). 
          </p>
          <p>
            Consider an example from "The Rich Man and the Chicken" by <span lang="ja">小川未明</span> (OGAWA Mimei). 
            Note that the mono ruby for <span lang="ja">新鮮</span> is expressed by two rt (ruby annotation) elements: 
            one ruby annotation for <span lang="ja">新</span> and the other ruby annotation is for <span lang="ja">鮮</span>.
          </p>
          <section>
            <h5>Original text</h5>
            <p lang="ja">

              If there are no ruby annotations, this should be read aloud as:<br/>

              (Niwatori demo katte shinsenna tamagowo umashite tabeyouto omoimashita.)

          <p>
            Since there are two ruby annotations, double-sided ruby leads to reading aloud three times. 
            One of the ruby annotations is typically furigana, so the description in 1) applies. 
            If the other ruby annotation is a Gikun, the description in 2) applies; 
            if it is an interlinear note, the description in 4) applies.

	  <h4>Zaima annotation, when both read aloud</h4>
	  <p>The option of reading both aloud is sensible and
	assumed. Since the role of zaima annotation is to provide
	inflection guidance, the annotation is implicit in the
	vocalization.  However, if the annotation is read aloud
	verbatim, without tonal interpretation, along with the base,
	the reading does not make any sense at all and is analogous to
	the Furigana case.</p>

        <h3>Reading aloud ruby annotations only</h3>
        <p>
          In this option, ruby annotations are read aloud but ruby bases are not.

          <h4>Furigana, when ruby annotations read aloud</h4>
          <p>
            The option of reading aloud ruby annotations only provides not-incorrect-but-unnatural results usually. 
            In some cases, it causes mistakes in deciding whether <span lang="ja">へ</span> should be read aloud 
            as <span lang="ja">え</span> (/e/) or <span lang="ja">へ</span> (/he/) and 
            whether <span lang="ja">は</span> should be read aloud as <span lang="ja">わ</span> (/wa/) or <span lang="ja">は</span> (/ha/). 
            This is because the morphological analysis does not work properly and pronunciation dictionaries 
            for compound words cannot be used, as kana characters are used instead of CJK ideographic characters.
            As an example, consider <span lang="ja">今後は<ruby><rb>発展</rb><rt>はってん</rt></ruby></span>. 
            Text-to-speech of <span lang="ja">今後は発展</span> typically works fine but that of <span lang="ja">今後ははってん</span> does not. 
            The first occurrence of <span lang="ja">は</span> should be read aloud as <span lang="ja">わ</span> (/wa/) 
            but is mistakenly read aloud as <span lang="ja">は</span> (/ha/).
          </p>
          <p>
            Even when this option is used, it might be wise to ignore furigana-added-for-enhanced-accessibility but rely on ruby bases.
          </p>
          <p>
            If furigana is assigned only for the first occurrence of a word, 
            there is a risk that the first occurrence and the others are read aloud differently.
          </p>
          <aside class="note" title="" id="n20211101002">
            One way to avoid this problem is for the text-to-speech engine to maintain a correspondence table between ruby bases and ruby annotations.

            The characters that can be read out aloud by TTS engines are currently limited to JIS X 0208:1997.

        <h3>Conversion from small kana characters to full-size kana characters</h3>
        <p>
          Small kana characters <span lang="ja">ゃ</span>, <span lang="ja">ゅ</span>, <span lang="ja">ょ</span>, and 
          <span lang="ja">っ</span> are too small when they appear in ruby annotations. 
          For this reason, instead of these small characters, full-size kana characters <span lang="ja">や</span>, 
          <span lang="ja">ゆ</span>, <span lang="ja">よ</span>, and <span lang="ja">つ</span> are used in ruby annotations.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, since full-size kana characters are pronounced differently from small kana, 
          ruby annotations containing full-size kana are read aloud differently.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS has a mechanism for overcoming this problem. 
          Value '<a data-cite="css-text-3" data-xref-type="css-value" data-xref-for="text-transform">full-size-kana</a>' of 
          the <a data-cite="css-text-3" data-xref-type="css-property">text-transform</a> property as specified in CSS Text converts 
          small kana characters to full-size kana. 
          It is thus possible to use small kana in ruby annotations while rendering them using full-size kana. 
          Text-to-speech engines can provide correct results even when ruby annotations are read aloud.

        <h3>A single ruby element or multiple ruby elements per one compound word</h3>
        <p>
          Okayama-san of Hitach has argued that, even in the case of mono ruby, 
          creating a single ruby element per compound word is better than creating a ruby element for each character of the ruby base in a compound word. 
          For example, to attach mono ruby to <span lang="ja">生命</span>, he recommends a single ruby element and two sets of rb and rt elements: 
          one for <span lang="ja">生</span> and another for <span lang="ja">命</span> rather than creating two ruby elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          A single ruby element per compound word can be rendered as mono ruby or jukugo ruby by CSS. 
          Moreover, it is also easy for the text-to-speech engine to maintain a correspondence table between ruby bases and ruby annotations.

          difficulties with CJK ideographic characters, it is unnecessary or slightly disturbing for others. 
          If furigana-added-for-enhanced-accessibility is distinguishable from normal furigana, 
          it can be made visible or invisible depending on user preferences.

      <h2>Alternatives to ruby</h2>

      <p>[[?SSML]] and [[?PRONUNCIATION-LEXICON]] offer alternatives for
      conveying phonemic and phonetic pronunciations of CJK ideographic 
      characters to speech synthesis engines. These methods are not intended for visual 
      presentations but can offer superior control over text-to-speech compared to using ruby.</p>
      
      <section>
        <h3>SSML</h3>
	<p>
	  [[?SSML]] employs symbol collections (such as IPA and
	  [[?JEITA_IT-4006]]) to represent the sounds of human
	  languages. Phonemic and phonetic pronunciations are conveyed
	  through sequences of these symbols.
	</p>
	<p>
	  [[?epub-32]] allows the use of SSML attributes within
	  <a data-cite="epub-33#dfn-xhtml-content-document">XHTML
	  content documents</a> in EPUB publications. In [[?epub-33]],
	  these attributes are relocated to
	  [[?epub-tts-10]]. Meanwhile, the W3C Accessible Platform
	  Architectures Working Group is developing [[?spoken-html]],
	  which outlines two potential methods for incorporating SSML
	  attributes into HTML elements.</p>

	<p>
	  In Japan, SSML finds extensive application in digital
	  textbooks, adopted by the biggest textbook publisher in
	  Japan. However, it has been noted that attaching SSML
	  attributes to CJK ideographic characters significantly

        <h3>PLS</h3>
	<p>PLS ([[PRONUNCIATION-LEXICON]]) enables the use of pronunciation lexicons, which map words to
	  sequences of symbol collections such as those found in IPA or
	  [[?JEITA_IT-4006]].
	  </p>
        <p>
          While SSML attributes are embedded within <a data-cite="epub-33#dfn-xhtml-content-document">XHTML content 
            documents</a> in EPUB publications, PLS lexicons 
	  in EPUB publications are stored
          externally to and referenced by <a data-cite="epub-33#dfn-xhtml-content-document">XHTML content documents</a>
          (see <a data-cite="epub-tts-10#pls">Pronunciation Lexicons
          section</a> in [[?epub-tts-10]]).  As of the present,
          [[spoken-html]] does not offer a mechanism for associationg
          PLS lexicons with HTML documents.
        </p>
        <p>
	  PLS is a robust tool for rendering unusual names of people
	  and places in text-to-speech applications.  In particular, PLS allows
	  every occurrence of a word or phrase to be consistently pronounced, 
	  regardless of the presence of ruby.  At the time of this writing, PLS is
	  used by at least one digital textbook publisher in Japan.

      <h2>Use of Ruby for Automatic Braille Translation</h2>
      <p>
	The conversion of HTML documents and EPUB publications to
	braille is expected to become increasingly important in the
	near future.
      </p>
      <p>
	Japanese braille lacks CJK ideographic characters and does not
	distinguish between hiragana and katakana. (Note: Han braille
	in Japan does include CJK ideographic characters, but it is
	not widely used.)
      </p>
      <p>
	Braille exhibits some syntactical differences from the
	Japanese writing system. First, space characters are inserted
	as delimiters between words. Second, two Japanese particles,
	<span lang="ja">は</span> and <span lang="ja">へ</span>, are transcribed as they are pronounced, meaning
	<span lang="ja">は</span> and <span lang="ja">へ</span> are represented as if they were
	<span lang="ja">わ</span> and <span lang="ja">え</span>,
	respectively. Third, <span lang="ja">う</span> pronounced as an elongated sound is
	represented using the long vowel character. For example,
	to tranlsate <span lang="ja">たいよう</span> to braille,
	<span lang="ja">たいよう</span> is first converted to <span lang="ja">たいよー</span> and then translated to braille.
      </p>
      <p>
	Natural language processing is required to handle these
	differences during the conversion to braille. However, unlike
	the case of text-to-speech, intonation is not relevant.
      </p>
      <p>
	When converting HTML or EPUB content to braille, it is
	essential to select the correct reading for each CJK
	ideographic character. Choosing an incorrect reading can
	result in erroneous braille output. Similar to text-to-speech,
	ruby provides valuable hints, while [[?SSML]] and PLS
	([[?PRONUNCIATION-LEXICON]]) serve as effective alternatives.
      </p>
      <p>
	For furigana and the transcription of unusual names of people
        and places, natural language processing is more effective when
        using ruby bases (typically containing CJK ideographic
        characters) as the foundation. In contrast, the correct
        readings are chosen when using ruby annotations as the
        basis. It is also possible to combine both ruby bases and ruby
        annotations.
