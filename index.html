      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        We are concerned about issues around the text-to-speech of HTML documents and EPUB publications containing ruby. 
        Although typographical characteristics of ruby are covered by [[?JLREQ]] and [[?simple-ruby]], 
        text-to-speech issues have not been widely recognized. This document focuses on user requirements, 
        while a companion document (now in Japanese only) focuses on implementation issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Section 2 enumerates the roles of ruby annotation play in relation to its base text. 
        Section 3 describes possible options for using base text and/or ruby annotation for the text-to-speech and discusses 
        the pros and cons of each option. 
        Section 4 shows ruby markup issues around the text-to-speech. 
        Section 5 introduces alternative mechanisms (SSML and PLS). 
        Section 6 describes the use of ruby in translating HTML or EPUB to braille.
        And Section 7 provides a brief summary of the text-to-speech of Word documents and PDF documents containing ruby.

      <h2>Roles of Ruby annotation</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>Furigana</h3>
        <p>
          The primary use of ruby annotation is to indicate how to read CJK ideographic characters 
          (<dfn>furigana</dfn>, see also <a data-cite="JLREQ#term.furigana">JLReq terminology</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Nowadays, it is not common to attach ruby annotations to every CJK ideographic characters 
          (<dfn>general ruby</dfn>, see also <a data-cite="JLREQ#term.general-ruby">JLReq terminology</a>).
          Ruby annotations are typically attached to difficult CJK ideographic characters only 
          (<dfn>para ruby</dfn>, see also <a data-cite="JLREQ#term.para-ruby">JLReq terminology</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Ruby is used in trade books, newspapers, textbooks, teaching materials, etc., but is rarely used in business documents.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even for simple CJK ideographic characters, ruby annotations may be added for some users who have particular 
          difficulties with CJK ideographic characters 
          (in electronic documents, it is easy to make ruby annotations visible or invisible based on user preferences). 
          Such ruby annotations are called as furigana-added-for-enhanced-accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some simple CJK ideographic characters have more than one possible reading and thus require ruby annotations for disambiguation.  
          This is common for names of people and places. For example, "<span lang="ja">山崎</span>" (a person's name) may be read as 
          "Yamazaki" or "Yamasaki". 
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case of para ruby, ruby annotation is often attached to the first occurrence of each CJK ideographic character, 
          and not attached to the second and subsequent occurrences of the same character, 
          probably because users should learn from the first occurrence.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Gikun</h3>
        <p>
          Especially in Japan, ruby annotation is also used for indicating something different from the reading of a CJK ideographic character.
          Such ruby is called <dfn>Gikun</dfn>.  Gikun tends to be used in light novels and comics. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are some examples of Gikun:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span lang="ja"><ruby><rb>生命</rb><rt>いのち</rt></ruby></span> 
            (the typical reading of <span lang="ja">生命</span> is SEIMEI rather than <span lang="ja">いのち</span> (INOCHI), 
            where both <span lang="ja">生命</span> and <span lang="ja">いのち</span> mean "Life")
          </li>
          <li>
            <span lang="ja"><ruby><rb>背景</rb><rt>バック</rt></ruby></span> 
            (the typical reading of <span lang="ja">背景</span> is HAIKEI rather than <span lang="ja">バック</span> ("back"), 
            which is an English translation)
          </li>
          <li>
            <span lang="ja"><ruby><rb>牛乳</rb><rt>ミルク</rt></ruby></span> 
            (the typical reading of <span lang="ja">牛乳</span> is GYUUNYUU rather than <span lang="ja">ミルク</span> ("milk"), 
            which is an English translation)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Even when Gikun is used for a compound word, it is unlikely to be repeated for later occurrences of the same word. 
          Moreover, different [=GIKUN=] may be added for subsequent occurrences of the same word. 
          For example, the next occurrence of <span lang="ja">生命</span> may well be 
          <span lang="ja"><ruby><rb>生命</rb><rt>ライフ</rt></ruby></span>
          where <span lang="ja">ライフ</span> ("life") is an English translation.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Unusual names of people and places</h3>
        <p>
          Unusual names of people in Japan are written in CJK ideographic characters but read as something completely 
          different from the typical reading of the CJK ideographic characters.  
          For example, <span lang="ja"><ruby><rb>男</rb><rt>あだむ</rt></ruby></span> is an unusual name, 
          where <span lang="ja">男</span> (usually read as OTOKO) means "man" and <span lang="ja">あだむ</span> is "Adam" in Kana.
        </p>
        <p>
          Character names in comics, animation and light novels are sometimes extremely difficult to read. 
          Many of the character names in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_Slayer:_Kimetsu_no_Yaiba">Demon Slayer (Kimetsu no Yaiba)</a> 
          fall into this category. 
          For example, almost no one can read <span lang="ja">不死川 玄弥</span> as "Shinazugawa Gennya" from the beginning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Names of places are sometimes hard to read for historical reasons. 
          For example, <span lang="ja"><ruby><rb>神居古潭</rb><rt>かむいこたん</rt></ruby></span>, 
          <span lang="ja"><ruby><rb>温根沼</rb><rt>おんねとう</rt></ruby></span>, 
          <span lang="ja"><ruby><rb>音威子府</rb><rt>おといねっぷ</rt></ruby></span> 
          are names of places in Hokkaido (the northern island of Japan). 
          These names are hard to read since they came from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ainu_people#Language">the Ainu language</a>, 
          which is totally different from the Japanese language.
        </p>
        <p>
          In many cases, the first occurrence of an unusual name is accompanied by ruby annotation but the other occurrences are not.
        </p>

        <h3>Interlinear notes</h3>
        <p>
          <dfn>Interlinear notes</dfn> look similar to ruby annotations.  
          A <a data-cite="JLREQ#n224">note in JLreq</a> introduces interlinear notes:
        </p>
        <aside class="note" title="Quoted note from JLReq" id="n20211101001">
          Other than these styles of note, explanations of facts and persons in study aid books and history texts, 
          and modern translations of Japanese classic texts are sometimes set between lines. 
          These notes are called interlinear notes (see <a data-cite="JLREQ#fig3_2_8">Figure 241</a>).
        </aside>
        <p>
          In the example shown in 
          <a data-cite="JLREQ#fig3_2_8">a figure referenced in quoted note ("An example of a note in inter lines")</a>, 
          <span lang="ja">徳川慶喜</span> (Tokugawa Yoshinobu) is accompanied by an interlinear note 
          "1837-1913 <span lang="ja">江戸幕府最後の将軍</span>" (1837-1913 the last shogun of the Edo shogunate). 
          Other examples are: a modern kana phrase as an interlinear note for a historical kana phrase, 
          a standard Japanese expression as an interlinear note for an expression in a dialect, 
          a modern CJK ideographic character as an interlinear note for a traditional CJK ideographic character, 
          an English text chunk as an interlinear note for a Japanese text chunk, 
          and an official name as an interlinear note for an abbreviated name.
        </p>
        <p>
          One could argue that HTML ruby elements should not be used for representing interlinear notes 
          (see <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-japanese/2021AprJun/0051.html">Kobayashi Sensei's mail in Japanese</a>). 
          However, it is not difficult to imagine that ruby elements are actually used for representing interlinear notes.

        <h3>Ruby annotation to indicate the reading of a foreign phrase in language textbooks</h3>
        <p>
          In language textbooks, ruby annotation is sometimes used to indicate the reading of a foreign phrase in hiragana or katakana. 
          For example, a Chinese phrase <span lang="zh-hans">我去学校</span> may have <span lang="ja">ウオ チュー シュエシャオ</span> as ruby annotation.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Double-sided Ruby</h3>
        <p>
          A sequence of base characters may be accompanied by two ruby annotations. 
          Typically, one of them is [=Furigana=] and the other is either a [=GIKUN=] or [=interlinear note=].  
          In <a data-cite="JLREQ#fig2_3_12">an example in JLreq</a> 
          ("An example of ruby attached to both sides of the base characters"), 
          <span lang="ja">東南</span> is accompanied by <span lang="ja">たつみ</span> and <span lang="ja">とうなん</span>. 
          Here <span lang="ja">東南</span> means "southeast", <span lang="ja">とうなん</span> (TOUNAN) is a [=furigana=], 
          and <span lang="ja">たつみ</span> (Tatsumi) is a [=GIKUN=], 
          since <span lang="ja">辰巳</span> (read as <span lang="ja">たつみ</span>) means the same direction as <span lang="ja">東南</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here <span lang="ja">とうよう</span> is a [=furigana=] and <span lang="ja">オリエント</span> is a [=Gikun=].

        </figure>
        <p>
          Here <span lang="ja">おだのぶなが</span> is a [=furigana=] and "1534-82" is an [=interlinear note=].

      <h2>Which should be read aloud, base text or ruby annotation, or both?</h2>
      <p>
        There are three possible options: (1) both base text and ruby annotation, (2) ruby annotation only, and (3) base text only.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Reading aloud both base text and ruby annoation</h3>
        <p>
          In this option, base text are read aloud first and ruby annotation is then read aloud. 
          Many implementations (screen readers, in particular) support this option only. 
          For example, <ruby><rb>foo</rb><rt>bar</rt></ruby> is read aloud as "foo bar".
        </p>

        <section>
          <h4>Furigana</h4>
          <p>
            The option of reading aloud both interferes with readers' understanding significantly. 
            This is true for both group ruby (see also <a data-cite="JLREQ#term.group-ruby">JLReq terminology</a>) 
            and mono ruby (see also <a data-cite="JLREQ#term.mono-ruby">JLReq terminology</a>). 
          </p>
          <p>
            Consider an example from "The Rich Man and the Chicken" by <span lang="ja">小川未明</span> (OGAWA Mimei). 
            Note that the mono ruby for <span lang="ja">新鮮</span> is expressed by two rt (ruby annotation) elements: 
            one ruby annotation for <span lang="ja">新</span> and the other ruby annotation is for <span lang="ja">鮮</span>.
          </p>
          <section>
            <h5>Original text</h5>
            <p lang="ja">
              <ruby><rb>鶏</rb><rt>にわとり</rt></ruby>でも<ruby><rb>飼</rb><rt>か</rt></ruby>って、
              <ruby><rb>新</rb><rt>しん</rt><rb>鮮</rb><rt>せん</rt></ruby>な

            </p>
            <p>
              If there is no ruby annotation, this should be read aloud as:<br/> 
              <span lang="ja">にわとりでもかって、しんせんなたまごをうましてたべようとおもいました。</span>
              (Niwatori demo katte shinsenna tamagowo umashite tabeyouto omoimashita.)
            </p>
            <p>
              Translation in English: I thought that I should raise a hen so that I can eat fresh eggs.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>Reading</h5>
            <p>
              The option of reading aloud both provides:<br/> 
              <span lang="ja">にわとりにわとりでもかかって、しんしんせんせんなたまごたまごをううましてたたべようとおもおもいました。</span>
              (Niwatoriniwatori demo kakatte shinshinsensenna tamagotamagowo uumashite tatabeyouto omoomoimashita.)
            </p>
            <p>
              This reading does not make any sense at all.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moreover, in some cases, reading both completely changes the meaning 
              <span class="todo">(see <a href="http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~eb2m-mrt/rubytest.html">examples</a>)</span>.

          <p>
            <span lang="ja"><ruby><rb>生命</rb><rt>いのち</rt></ruby></span> is read aloud as "Seimei Inochi", 
            where "Seimei" is a loan word from Chinese and "Inochi" is a native Japanese word.  Both means life.

          <h4>Ruby annotation to indicate the reading of a foreign phrase in language books</h4>
          <p>
            The option of reading aloud both interferes with readers' understanding significantly.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the example of <span lang="zh-hans">我去学校</span>,

            the result will not be helpful to learners because of the incorrect pronunciation and four tones. 
            Katakana pronunciation is also useless in languages such as English.

          <h4>Double-sided ruby</h4>
          <p>
            Since there are two chunks of ruby annotation, double-sided ruby leads to reading aloud three times. 
            One of the ruby annotations is typically furigana, so the description in 1) applies. 
            If the other ruby annotation is a Gikun, the description in 2) applies; 
            if it is an interlinear note, the description in 4) applies.

        <h3>Reading aloud ruby annotation only</h3>
        <p>
          In this option, ruby annotation is read aloud but base text is not. 
          For example, <ruby><rb>foo</rb><rt>bar</rt></ruby> is read aloud as "bar".
        </p>

        <section>
          <h4>Furigana</h4>
          <p>
            The option of reading aloud ruby annotation only provides not-incorrect-but-unnatural results usually. 
            In some cases, it causes mistakes in deciding whether <span lang="ja">へ</span> should be read aloud 
            as <span lang="ja">え</span> (/e/) or <span lang="ja">へ</span> (/he/) and 
            whether <span lang="ja">は</span> should be read aloud as <span lang="ja">わ</span> (/wa/) or <span lang="ja">は</span> (/ha/). 
            This is because the morphological analysis does not work properly and pronunciation dictionaries 
            for compound words cannot be used, as kana characters are used instead of CJK ideographic characters.
            As an example, consider <span lang="ja">今後は<ruby><rb>発展</rb><rt>はってん</rt></ruby></span>. 
            Text-to-speech of <span lang="ja">今後は発展</span> typically works fine but that of <span lang="ja">今後ははってん</span> does not. 
            The first occurrence of <span lang="ja">は</span> should be read aloud as <span lang="ja">わ</span> (/wa/) 
            but is mistakenly read aloud as <span lang="ja">は</span> (/ha/).
          </p>
          <p>
            Even when this option is used, it might be wise to ignore furigana-added-for-enhanced-accessibility but rely on base text.
          </p>
          <p>
            If furigana is assigned only for the first occurrence of a word, 
            there is a risk that the first occurrence and the others are read aloud differently.

          </p>

            But later occurrences of <span lang="ja">不死川玄弥</span> are read aloud as Fushikawa Genya if they do not have ruby annotation.

      <h2>Miscellaneous issues around ruby markup</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>Conversion from small kana characters to full-size kana characters</h3>
        <p>
          Small kana characters <span lang="ja">ゃ</span>, <span lang="ja">ゅ</span>, <span lang="ja">ょ</span>, and 
          <span lang="ja">っ</span> are too small when they appear in ruby annotation. 
          For this reason, instead of these small characters, full-size kana characters <span lang="ja">や</span>, 
          <span lang="ja">ゆ</span>, <span lang="ja">よ</span>, and <span lang="ja">つ</span> are used in ruby annotation.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, since full-size kana characters are pronounced differently from small kana, 
          ruby annotation containing full-size kana is read aloud differently.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS has a mechanism for overcoming this problem. 
          Value '<a data-cite="css-text-3" data-xref-type="css-value" data-xref-for="text-transform">full-size-kana</a>' of 
          the <a data-cite="css-text-3" data-xref-type="css-property">text-transform</a> property as specified in CSS Text converts 
          small kana characters to full-size kana. 
          It is thus possible to use small kana in ruby annotation while rendering ruby annotation using full-size kana. 
          Text-to-speech engines can provide correct results even when ruby annotation is read aloud.

        <h3>A single ruby element or multiple ruby elements per one compound word</h3>
        <p>
          Okayama-san of Hitach has argued that, even in the case of mono ruby, 
          creating a single ruby element per compound word is better than creating a ruby element for each character of base text in a compound word. 
          For example, to attach mono ruby to <span lang="ja">生命</span>, he recommends a single ruby element and two sets of rb and rt elements: 
          one for <span lang="ja">生</span> and another for <span lang="ja">命</span> rather than creating two ruby elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          A single ruby element per compound word can be rendered as mono ruby or jukugo ruby by CSS. 
          Moreover, it is also easy for the text-to-speech engine to maintain a correspondence table between base text and ruby annotation.

          Although furigana-added-for-enhanced-accessibility is necessary for those readers who have particular 
          difficulties with CJK ideographic characters, it is unnecessary or slightly disturbing for others. 
          If furigana-added-for-enhanced-accessibility is distinguishable from normal furigana, 
          it can be made visible or invisible depending on user preferences.

      <h2>Alternatives to ruby</h2>

      <p>[[?SSML]] and [[?PRONUNCIATION-LEXICON]] can be used for
      providing phonemic/phonetic pronunciation of CJK ideograph
      characters to speech synthesis engines.  They are not for visual
      presentations but can control text-to-speech much better than
      ruby.</p>
      
      <section>
        <h3>SSML</h3>
        <p>
	  [[?SSML]] uses symbol collections (such as IPA and JEITA
	  IT-4006) to represent the sounds of human languages.
	  Phonemic/phonetic pronunciation is represented by sequences
	  of such symbols.
        </p>  
        <p>
	  EPUB 3 allows SSML attributes to be used within XHTML content
	  documents in EPUB publications.  In the upcoming version,
	  EPUB 3.3, these attributes are moved to [[epub-tts-10]].
	  Meanwhile, the W3C Accessible Platform Architectures Working
	  Group is developing [[spoken-html]].  [[spoken-html]] describes
	  two possible approaches for adding SSML attributes to HTML elements.
        </p>
        <p>
	  [[?SSML]] is widely used for digital textbooks by more than
          one textbook publisher in Japan.  Meanwhile, it has been
          reported that attaching [[?SSML]] attributes to CJK
          ideographic characters significantly increases the authoring
          cost.  DAISY textbooks in Japan do not use SSML, since they
          include recorded voice.  Trade books in Japan do not use
          SSML either.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>PLS</h3>
	<p>PLS ([[PRONUNCIATION-LEXICON]]) allows for pronunciation lexicons, which maps words to
	  sequences of symbol collections such as those in IPA or
	  JEITA IT-4006.
	  </p>
        <p>
          While [[?SSML]] attributes are embedded within XHTML content
          documents in EPUB publications, PLS dictionaries (see
          [[?PRONUNCIATION-LEXICON]]) in EPUB publications are stored
          externally to and referenced by XHTML content documents
          (see <a data-cite="epub-tts-10#pls">Pronunciation Lexicons
          section</a> in [[?epub-tts-10]]).  As of now,
          [[spoken-html]] does not have a mechanism for associationg
          PLS lexicons to HTML documents.
        </p>
        <p>
          PLS is a powerful mechanism for the text-to-speech of
	  unusual names of people and places.  In particular, every
	  occurrence of a word or phrase is read aloud in the same way
	  regardless of the existence of ruby.  As of this writing, PLS is
	  used by at least one digital textbook publisher in Japan.

      <h2>Use of Ruby for Automatic Braille Translation</h2>
      <p>
        Conversion of HTML documents and EPUB publications to braille is expected to become important in the near future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Japanese braille does not have CJK ideographic characters and does not distinguish hiragana and katakana. 
        (Note: Han braille has CJK ideographic characters, but it is not widely used.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Braille has some syntactical differences from the Japanese writing system. 
        First, the space character is inserted as delimiters between words. 
        Second, two Japanese particles <span lang="ja">は</span> and <span lang="ja">へ</span> are written as they are pronounced; 
        that is, <span lang="ja">は</span> and <span lang="ja">へ</span> are represented 
        as if they were <span lang="ja">わ</span> and <span lang="ja">え</span>. 
        Third, <span lang="ja">う</span> pronounced as the elongated sound is represented by the long vowel character.
      </p>
      <p>
        Natural language processing is required for handling these differences in the conversion to braille. 
        But, unlike in the case of text-to-speech, intonation is not relevant. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To convert HTML or EPUB to braille, it is crucial to choose the correct reading of each CJK ideographic character. 
        If an incorrect reading is chosen, the generated braille becomes incorrect. 
        As in the case of text-to-speech, ruby provides useful hints while [[?SSML]] and PLS are good alternatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        For furigana and unusual names of people and places, natural language processing will work better 
        when CJK ideographic characters are used as a basis, while correct reading will be chosen when ruby annotation is used as a basis. 
        It is even possible to use both base text and ruby annotation.

      <h2>Document formats other than HTML and EPUB</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>OOXML</h3>
        <p>
          Microsoft Word reads aloud neither base text nor ruby annotation. Therefore, text-to-speech does not work when ruby is used.

      <section>
        <h3>PDF</h3>
        <p>
          Ruby in PDF documents is represented as separate lines containing tiny characters. 
          The relationship between base text and ruby annotation is not explicitly represented.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some implementations read aloud a line for ruby annotations first and then read corresponding original line, which contains base text. 
          Such implementations provide incomprehensible results.  Other implementations simply ignore lines for ruby annotation. 
          Subsection 3.3 applies to these implementations.
